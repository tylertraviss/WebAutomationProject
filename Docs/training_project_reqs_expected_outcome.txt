Requirements/Outcomes

Task 1: Web testing

[Auto] testing perspective:
1.	Test cases were created.
2.	BDD approach was used for test automation, so test cases can be linked (and back linked) to the code.
3.	A framework, that can be used to automate Web tests, is built.
4.	Framework is flexible and easy to use, so your colleague can automate other Web TCs using it.
5.	Each test execution provides reasonable reports (also linked to TCs)

Software development perspective:
1.	Code base is under version control (please do not delete branches after merge)
2.	Code was created with following [your favourite programming language] code standards and guidelines. 
3.	Code is documented.
4.	Framework provides sufficient and flexible logging.








Task 2: API testing

1.	API tests are automated within the framework (i.e., there is the same set of requirements as for Web tests)

OR

2.	API tests are automated using a Postman/SOAPUI-like tool. In that case, the solution:
2.1	can be run using different environments (suppose you have several)
2.2	can be run with parameters provided in a CSV file.
2.3	should be easily integrated into Continuous integration system (i.e., can be launched with command line interface)
